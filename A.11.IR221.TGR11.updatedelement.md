# Download Service feed contains feed updated element

**Purpose**: 

The Download Service feed must provide information about the date, time and timezone at which the feed was last updated in the [updated element](#updatedelement).

 **Test method**

* check if the [updated element](#updatedelement) exists and contains a correctly formatted date, including time and timezone.
* the date must not be in the future or too far in the past

**Reference(s)**: 

* TG, Req 11
* IR section 2.2.1, Metadata elements

**Test type**: Automated

**Notes**

[1] Not really practical to check if it is actually the correct date of last updating especially as ATOM spec allows this to be for "significant" updates.
[2] What should we consider too far in the past? Before 2000?
