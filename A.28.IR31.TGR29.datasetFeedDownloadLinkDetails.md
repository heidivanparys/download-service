# Dataset feed contains link to download dataset

**Purpose**: 

Each feed [entry](#entry) must contain an Atom "[link](#downloadlink)" element that links to the pre-defined dataset file described by the [entry](#entry). The value of the "rel" attribute of this element must be "alternate" and a "length" attribute (providing the length of the linked resource in octets \*) must be provided if possible. Where a dataset is provided in multiple physical files, additional "[link](#downloadlink)" elements must be provided in the feed [entry](#entry), one link for each physical file.

\* 1 octet = 8 bits (usually synonymous with 1 byte)

**Test method**

* test if at least one feed entry is available with at least one [link](#downloadlink) to download a file
* resolve all [links](#downloadlink) in the dataset feed. Use HTTP HEAD to avoid downloading large datasets where possible.

**Reference(s)**: 

* TG, Req 29
* IR section 3.1, Get Spatial Data Set Operation

**Test type**: 

Automated

**Notes**

[1] this overlaps with TG Requirement 26. This requirement gives more details about how to encode the link.
